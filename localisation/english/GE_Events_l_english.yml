With the help of the research team, we gradually understand the essence of N-field - born in void. The void "holds up" innumerable universes. It is indescribable and does not have any nature, but it also has any nature. Our scientists try to understand it as the duality of chaos and nothingness, Here is the beginning from nothing to infinity and the end from infinity to nothing. N-field exists in the void like a bridge, connecting all universes. We can't understand how this kind of thing comes into being. Maybe it's the mistake of the multiverse, or the ultimate creation of some existence, or the prank of the mysterious white rabbit."

The chief scientists decided to explore the nature of the doors first. \nThe research team of the Black Hole Gate was ordered to bring the strong gravitational fields generator into the N-field, A few days later, Mercury Lamp led them to an isolated door. They conducted an experiment on the gravitational effect next to the door.\nThe experimental results are disturbing:The appearance of the door began to twist and collapse under the action of strong gravitational fields - we destroyed its stable form, and finally it collapsed into a Light-Spot. \n§RThe frightening energy readings§! made the entire research team vey nervous, but it seems that's all.

ge_event.40.desc:0 "An accident happened. \nThe research team almost entered a cycle:At first they released hydrogen to the Light-Spot, and the sensor soon lost its detection of hydrogen, Then they plan to be more aggressive and bring an alloy into contact with light spot. \nThe alloy was disappeared, along with the memory of the people present, the database records, and all the information about the alloy was erased - it was erased as if it had never existed. So the scientific research team invested the second and third blocks without any awareness...\nGradually, people and substance in direct contact with those alloys began to disappear, but no one found them. Then there were their witnesses, their manufacturers, their origin, and even the space......\n§RThe light spot is getting brighter and brighter - unknown erosion is spreading. "

After sorting out the previous research data, we confirm that the light spot has reached the void, N-field has a certain suppression effect on the void erosion of light spot, but the effect is very limited. The chief scientists believe that if this light spot enters the real universe directly, it will cause something more terrible than vacuum decay. \nNow I always stare at the light spot in a daze unconsciously, and so do my colleagues. Fortunately, we can remind each other...Today, there is no arrangement for my experiment. I can stay away from that weird light spot and go back to the station to have a relax."

To be honest, we all have no bottom, but everyone knows what that §Renergy reading§! represents——This is the energy source that can cause an unprecedented revolution in productivity, If we can understand the mystery of the light spot, our motherland will advance by leaps and bounds. This is our duty, we shall know no fear."

Mercury Lamp believes that the output of our existing reactor is insufficient to generate a stronger gravitational fields, resulting in the inability to guide the energy of the light spots... Perhaps only the §Hzero point reactor§! in theory can meet the requirements. \nAlthough we can't do anything about the so-called zero point reactor for the time being, we have studied the energy source of the light spot, which seems to be produced by the decay of the void towards energy, which is incredible...\nI find that I'm becoming more and more forgetful. Is it because I've been working too hard lately? It can't be that light spot. Our research results have long confirmed our safety...huh..."

Fortunately, it resisted. \nAlthough the new energy source immediately took over the burden of the overloaded reactor, it still exploded, The power of its explosion is like the energy released by several neutron torpedoes at the same time...This is perhaps the most dazzling flash in the N-field ever. \nThe experimental site is perfectly protected by the shield, All the people present were watching the flash. whether they were stimulated by the strong light or moved by the bitterness and happiness. They all burst into tears. "
ge_event.60.aa:0 "Light is the meaning of everything!"

ge_event.61.title:0 "Godsend"
ge_event.61.desc:0 "We named this void energy reactor "Aurora", Although this energy from the decay of the void still has similar assimilation and phagocytosis, it is much safer than the void itself. \nIn the development project of the previous generation engine, our beloved H.E. mercury lamp led the team to overcome the threshold limit of the connection between the real world and n-field. As long as the supply is sufficient, we can quickly open the door of n-field at a specific location. Therefore, our ships can effectively use our new reactor through logical opening and closing. \nThere are many doors here like stars, and our void interface is endless. Now, change has begun. "

The time velocity in this strange space is not affected by the gravity of the black hole, which seems to be no different from the clock on the research ship.

With the door opened, a purple light spot emerged from the trunk. With the trunk, they broke through vines's blocking and flew to the UAV outside the door.
